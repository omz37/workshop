## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compile
```
npm run serve
```

STEP 1:
- go to App.vue
and modify the <v-app-bar> component so it has a nice color and style :)

docs:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/app-bars/#api


STEP 2:
- go to HelloWorld.vue and create a v-btn, add a method in the <script> part to allow the button
to change color when it is clicked

docs:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/buttons/
search for the v-btn '@click' events
and search for 'how to assign css style to v-btn'

STEP 3:
- now time to create a new Vue component, create 2/3 v-card with nice v-rows and v-cols

- now search for VueRoute -> when you click on the HelloWorld.vue v-btn you need to be redirect to your new VueComponent

docs:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/cards/
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/grids/ for nice flexboxes
https://router.vuejs.org/guide/#html to route to new component

STEP 4:
- you can use v-img to insert images on your new component
add a nice and high quality image in your v-card

docs:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/images/

STEP 5:
- SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT
you have 30 mins to use buttons, cards, images and possibly routing to make the best looking interface
for a photographer's webapp
the winner gets to be a part of my next Music Video ;)
